# Project-1


The purpose of this project was to investigate the wave equation, quantum harmonic oscillators, and numerical integration over infinite
domains. This was done by looking at motivation for the time-independent Schrödinger equation to understand the shape of the quantum 
SHO’s wave function. We then used a change of variables to transform an infinite integral to allow for an approximation of the quantum 
particle’s positional uncertainty. Wave equations are important in calculating the probability of a particle’s position by describing 
their state of motion. The solution for the quantum SHO is well known and can be used to model diatomic molecules such as HCl. Being 
able to provide a numerical solution for an infinite integral allows us to perform what would normally be impossible calculation in mere 
seconds through the use of a computer.

The Jupyter project "Quantum Uncertainty in the Harmonic Oscillator" provides a break down of the basics about a quantum harmonic 
oscillator. This includes the the first few eigen states, inspection of the energy level for n=5 eigen state, and using expectation values 
to determine the uncertainty in the oscillators position.
